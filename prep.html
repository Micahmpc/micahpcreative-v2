        <p>
          Prep Sportswear is an online retailer that sells customizeable fan gear across K-12, college, vintage, and military channels to name a few. At the time of this project, Prep had been growing annually in the 20-40% range for a few years. Our team was responsible for all design creation for apparel, and some website/content related tasks as well. I had taken over much of the technical side of the teams workload and was the lead for all design related issues coming up from production. I was put in charge of leading an effort to reduce error and replacement rates in order to lower costs and increase efficiency.

          This project involved stakeholders from design (my team), production, and engineering teams. We also worked closely with customer service who reported on issues, and helped the design team manage the licensing and relationships with licensing agencies. These teams/stakeholders were also our sole users.

        <p>
          With the recent growth of the company, production issues that had historically not been a huge issue began to balloon in costs to the company. We also had been aquiring licensing rights to a number of larger D1 and D2 college, and were responsible for maintaining their high-level of brand standards as such.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the project, we highlighted a number of processes that needed improvements to efficiency, and areas where improvements needed to be made in order to keep up with the growing demand and the growing number of licenses we were aquiring.

          <p>
            Over the course of the project on the production improvement side, I created new documentation, reworked and improved processes and reporting measures,  and helped research, setup, and integrate new machines, tools, and software to improve accuracy.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the process efficiency side, I created a number of internal tools for stakeholders on the design and production teams to quickly create and upload assets to the website, create licensing assets, and rework/update data and mappings.

          The research all came from active issues we were having. In that respect, the initial research would be brought to us by the production team or customer service. We would follow up with the reporters for more detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          The company didn't provide a clear direction for the project, so I brought a few stakeholders into a planning meeting to define our approach. We defined our first key task which was to build a reporting tool to improve communication. The rest of the project was taken in stride as we defined new needs along the way.

        <p>
          We needed to change the flow of information in order for us to track down the issues more quickly, and get better information. We also needed to build it in a way that made it more difficult for information to be sent to the wrong place which could lead to unneccessary work and having more involved parties than was absolutely essential. So, we built the newly defined process into the tools we started to create.

        <p>
          For all the updates, additions, and new tools we built, I would figure out the requirements and features needed via research, then take those into sketches and wireframes. Many of the wireframes were put together by disecting other tools so the engineers could leverage the components. Those wireframes were passed off to the engineers I was working with to build. Once we had a prototype built of the tool, I would run it in a test environment, then once approved we would tie it into the real system.

        <p>
          The first tool we lauched (seen above) was the design fix tool. It was a real-time reporting and tracking tool that improved communication between teams working on production fixes to design files and our proporietary processing software. It allowed users with access to the production tools to put order line items into a list of designs needing to be fixed, kept track of previous fixes to allow for easy reference, and enabled on-page communication/chat to work through problems.

        <p>
          To improve the way that we created and tracked licensing approvals, I built two more simple tools. The first was a simple tracking sheet that showed when things were created and submitted, and had a ping function to notify others when needed. This was paired with an approval document creator that allowed its users to create the documents quickly using drag-and-drop, saved out the files in the format required by the different agencies, and without having to temporarily turn designs on on to create, and back off before they were approved. This also removed the possiblility for designs to be left on by accident, which could be bad for our agreement with the licensing agencies and schools.

        <p>
          I created documentation for design file setup, and manuals for use of tools. This started standardizing the process, and producing better and more manageable content. With the increased level of uniformity, we were able to tackle larger numbers of files at a time with the help of engineers who could now write scripts or programs to seek out specified files and do bulk updates without designers having to go into each file and do it manually. This tied back into colleges especially for when they changed their branding which happened frequently across the board.

          Now that we had time to focus with errors rates going down, I designed - on request of our marketing team and my creative director - a tool that was able to track sales of our designs so that we could fine-tune our collections and offerings. This was also meant to help with error rates as it would allow us to quickly see if problematic designs were worth our effort of fixing or not. Ultimately this tools was scrapped and we wrote a couple of SQL scripts we could run to get the same info.

          The final piece of the puzzle was making sure our machines were outputting the best possible work. Myself and my pointman in production (our on-site designer in the production facility) learned how to color profile printers, and our engineers worked to purchase newer more capable machines. We then all flew to Louisville where our manufacturing was to oversee the setup of and test the machines before returning home and being able to make the remaining improvements remotely.

          After one year which included the planning, tool building, and integration of new machines and technology, error rates had started rapidly decreasing. Within about 15 months, we had brought the 30-45% error rates down to a steady 5% on average. The majority of that 5% being attributable to edge case scenarios or accidental human error. Furthermore, the company now had documentation, standarization, and process improvements that saved countless hours of busywork and greatly improved accuracy of work.

          This project was actually my intro to UX and designing processes as well as just graphic/visual things. Before this I had been exclusively a graphic designer, and somewhat unaware of UX and how it affects the design of everything we touch and not just computers. I really fell in love with the problem solving and strategic parts of the process. It also highlighted the need across different settings to have clearly defined documentation and well thought out communication.
