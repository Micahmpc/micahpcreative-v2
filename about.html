          Hi, I'm Micah Parker. I went to school for Graphic Design and Business, thinking I wanted to be a professional artist. After college I traveled on my own through South America. When I returned to Seattle, I started selling my artwork and printing t-shirts in my basement, which led me to my career in Graphic Design. Since then I've had opportunity to continue growing professionally through Graphic and Visual Design, to Web Development, to my main focus: Product Design and UX.

            When I was in middle school, I was probably twelve, we all had to take one of those tests that are meant to predict what you’ll be when you’re all grown up. To set the scene, my father is a computer guy. My introduction to computers was in 1986, the year I was born.
          </p>
          <p>
            We were given the test, and I’ll never forget it - a good third of the questions were about computers. Do you have a computer in your house? Yes. How many computers do you have in your house? 4, at the moment. Do you have one in your bedroom? The results would quickly become a family joke. <span class="txt600">I was destined to become a computer nerd, just my like dad.</span>

            In tenth grade (2002), I was taking a photography class and had just gotten back from a trip to New York where I took some great shots. When I brought it back to photography class and developed it, many had great composition but I wanted more than I was able to do in the darkroom. <span class="txt600">My teacher introduced me to this program called Photoshop</span>. She didn’t know it really and didn’t particularly know computers that well, but the school had put it on a few of the four computers in her classroom. “Play around a bit. Figure it out.” At the end-of-semester art show, I sold a number of prints - all digitally enhanced. From then on I never stopped "playing around".
          </p>
          <p>
            In college I decided to double major in business and studio art. Turns out too, that there’s an art to business. I loved my global marketing class, and earned the top honor for my final project where I invented a concept product to be placed in a foreign market. <span class="txt600">Global marketing served as my introduction and serenade to building products and strategies</span>. I loved trying to solve the puzzles of creating and positioning a product in the world. I still do.

            When I returned from South America, I started selling my art while I was working as the cook at a local bar. I built a silk screen press out of wood for $40, and started slanging t-shirts and art prints at local art walks, coffee shops, and even out of my backpack in my daily travels with a lookbook I carried in a 3-ring binder. <span class="txt600">It was that side-hustle that got me my first real design job and started my career</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 8 years since then, I have done digital illustration and design, visual design, user experience and product design, and found a love for writing code even. <span class="txt600">Product Design and UX for me is an amalgamation of my past, my present, and my future. It affords me room to be creative, analytical, strategic, and formulaic</span>. Both sides of my brain are exercised. I’ve also found a passion for woodworking and fishing in the past few years which both allow me to get creative, tricky, and methodical in my approach. They also keep me forever learning.
