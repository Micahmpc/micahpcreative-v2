          Aetlas is a globally concious funding platform for campaigns to launch products and initiatives that positively affect the planet and its people. Campaigners can build their projects, choose from different types of funding options, and grow ideas into ecocentric successes. Donors can browse through featured and/or specific projects to find products or projects they can feel passionate about, and get behind them.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Crowdfunding and fundraising sites have a hard time with user trust and retention. There are issues with campaigns not being able to meet promised production quotas when they are successfully funded, and they are often abused which leads to them to become oversaturated with campaigns and deemed untrustworthy as a whole.

          <p>
            Aetlas seeks to set itself apart from the pack by getting back to the core of why crowdfunding was invented. To help breathe life into ideas worthy enough to become realized. It approaches trust and retention by using it's brand identity and campaign building process as a filter. By removing the some of the ability to abuse the platform, Aetlas aims to rebuild trust around it's platform, and increase retention rates by making users feel safe first, then helping them feel like they're making a difference by  showing their interest and support.

          For the research I sent out a survey asking users about their interaction and experience with these platforms. I approached it in two parts - first tackling questions related to being a donor. Then the second focused on how people want to set up campaigns, and some pain points they might have had if they have prior experience.

          After the survey, I did a number of follow-up interviews to dig deeper. I was fortunate enough to interview a few potential users who, between them, spanned the spectrum from casual/novice donor to non-profit fundraiser to a marketer who specializes in crowdfunding and campaign building.

          Now that I had defined the problem, the user, and the direction, I started working out how the user would move through the site, and how it was structured. I ran a card-sort study using Optimal Workshop which gave me my architecture and sitemap. Then I started working through user-flows to solve for the MVP. This included creating a campaign, campaign management, sign up/sign in, and member and guest donor flows.

          For the interface I started with some quick sketches and notes, and began building the low fidelity version of the app. All the screens were done in XD, and compiled into a working prototype in InVision. They covered sign up and sign on, project browsing with search and filter, project pages, and checkout on the donor side. The campaign host side had the projects  dashboard, and project manager.

          I shopped the prototype around for some remote testing. I gave the participants a number of standard tasks to walk through to make the platform was understandable and simple enough, and to get some feedback. For preference testing I did a number of A/B tests with Usability Hub for things like how to handle pagination, credit card input, and whether users wanted a dark or light UI.

          While the user and preference tests were cooking, I used the time to develop the branding. I took inspiration for the future from Nike (Air Mag & HyperAdapt 1.0 - Tinker Hatfield is a huge idol of mine), innovations happening in Europe like solar LED roads for better night vision, and many green energy projects happening worldwide.

        <p>
          Since the brand was positioned around sustainability, and the identity of the platform was one of trust and innovation, I aimed for teals to mix blue for trust and green for innovation. The logo itself is a deconstructed icon of a classic world map. I created other iconography for the homepage on the same wavelength.

        <h5>Takeaway</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The concept for Aetlas takes a trust-first approach. What the research initially highlighted showed me that the idea of crowdfunding had a ton of merit, but the implementations I saw created environments without barriers to entry. I see this issue going beyond just crowdfunding - the internet itself has no barriers, and it can be both a great and terrible place. Barriers can be good and bad, you don't want to turn people away, but at the same time - in some settings like this, you also don't always want a free-for-all.
        </p>
        <p>
          I look at OfferUp a lot in regards to trust (and Uber). They've taken major steps to overcome the negatives associated with Craigslist and user safety. For Aetlas, are there more vetting processes to alleviate pains potential abuse of platform, that don't deter your desired users as well?
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm left wondering if one could somehow add non-tangible rewards for campaigners to form a sort of habit loop that further improves retention. Maybe like creating a follower type of system with campaigners where donors could follow you and see what your latest campaign is all about. Philanthropists like Bill Gates and J.J Watt could maybe inspire a lot more good than they already do.
