          Aetlas is a globally conscious funding platform for campaigns to launch products and initiatives that positively affect the planet and its people. Campaigners can build their projects, choose from different types of funding options, and grow ideas into ecocentric successes. Donors can browse through featured and/or specific projects to find products or projects they can feel passionate about, and get behind them.

        <h5>Problem</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Crowdfunding and fundraising sites have a hard time with user trust and retention. There are issues with campaigns not being able to meet promised production quotas when they are successfully funded, and they are often abused which leads to them to become oversaturated with campaigns and deemed untrustworthy as a whole.
        </p>

          <h5>Solution</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <p>
            Aetlas seeks to set itself apart from the pack by getting back to the core of why crowdfunding was invented. To help breathe life into ideas worthy enough to become realized. It approaches trust and retention by using its brand identity and campaign building process as a filter. By removing the some of the ability to abuse this type of platform, Aetlas aims to rebuild trust around its own platform and increase retention rates by making users feel safe first, then helping them feel like they're making a difference by showing their interest and support.

          I ran a SWOT analysis on a few popular crowdfunding and fundraising platforms to see where they were succeeding and where there was room to improve. This step illuminated how I could separate Aetlas from what's out there, and also gave me a few key "what not to do" points.

          For the research, I sent out a survey asking users about their interaction and experience with these platforms. I approached it in two parts - first tackling questions related to being a donor. Then the second focused on how people want to set up campaigns, and some pain points they might have had if they have prior experience.

        At this point in the research I had the direction I wanted to go in (sustainability). This direction would also allow me to use it as a barrier of entry to undisirable types of use. To get my architecture I did a card sort study via Optimal Workshop, which gave me the breakdown I needed to know which categories I should add or merge into one.

          After the survey, I did a number of follow-up interviews to dig deeper. I was fortunate enough to interview a few potential users who, between them, spanned the spectrum from casual/novice donor to a non-profit fundraiser to a marketer who specializes in crowdfunding and campaign building.

          Now that I had defined the problem, the user, and the direction, I started working out how the user would move through the site, and how it was structured. I ran a card-sort study using Optimal Workshop which gave me my architecture and sitemap. Then I started working through user-flows to solve for the MVP. This included creating a campaign, campaign management, sign up/sign in, and member and guest donor flows.

          For the interface, I started with some quick sketches and notes and began building the low fidelity version of the app. All the screens were done in XD and compiled into a <a href="https://invis.io/JFN68JM56E7" target="_blank">working prototype in InVision</a>. They covered sign up and sign on, project browsing with search and filter, project pages, and checkout on the donor side. The campaign host side had the projects dashboard, and project manager.

I gave the participants a number of standard tasks to walk through to make the platform was understandable and simple enough, and to get some feedback. For preference testing, I did a number of A/B tests with Usability Hub for things like how to handle pagination, credit card input, and whether users wanted a dark or light UI.

          While the user and preference tests were cooking, I used the time to develop the branding. I took inspiration for the future from Nike (<a href="https://news.nike.com/news/how-to-get-the-2016-nike-mag" target="_blank">Air Mag</a> & <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/09/nike-self-lacing-design-hyperadapt/" target="_blank">HyperAdapt 1.0</a> - Tinker Hatfield is a huge idol of mine), innovations happening in Europe like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlTA3rnpgzU&feature=youtu.be&t=7" target="_blank">solar LED roads</a> for better night vision, and many green energy projects happening worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the brand was positioned around sustainability and the identity of the platform was one of trust and innovation, I aimed for teals to mix blue for trust and green for innovation. The logo itself is a deconstructed icon of a classic world map. I created other iconography for the homepage on the same wavelength.

          For the prototype, I wanted to be as thorough as possible to ensure users demoing the product didn't get lost as I saw a bit in the lo-fi tests. That meant creating the screens for guest and member flows starting at the homepage and guiding them all the way through browse and on to completing checkout. I also made sure that all functionality was accounted for - meaning dropdowns working, clickable buttons, and menus working on all pages.

        <h5>Takeaway</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The concept for Aetlas takes a trust-first approach. What the research initially highlighted showed me that the idea of crowdfunding had a ton of merit, but the implementations I saw created environments without barriers to entry. I see this issue going beyond just crowdfunding - the internet itself has no barriers, and it can be both a great and terrible place. Barriers can be good and bad, you don't want to turn people away, but at the same time - in some settings like this, you also don't always want a free-for-all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aetlas made me very aware of designing with user-trust in mind and how that can affect your product. It raised questions, like are there vetting processes to alleviate pains potential abuse of platform - that don't deter your desired users as well? Or how can effectively deter certain users via the process?
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm left wondering if one could somehow add non-tangible rewards for campaigners to form a sort of habit loop that further improves retention and implies improved trust if that loop continues to work. Maybe creating a follower type of system with campaigners where donors could follow you and see what your latest campaign is all about?
