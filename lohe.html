          I was hired for a full website refresh by the Law Offices of Helene Ellebogen, P.S., a local seattle family law firm. Their website was last updated in 2006. The lawyer was slowly ramping down her business as she approached retirement, but had recently sold a good portion of her business to an up and coming lawyer's firm. She wanted a total overhaul and redesign that she could use and then pass on when she retired fully.

        <p>
          The most glaring problem was the lack of responsive on her current website. No doubt her search rankings were negatively affected by this. That was the main point of the overhaul. She also wanted a new design that better reflected current design trends and for people to be able to view her site on their devices which was not possible with her legacy website.

          <p>
            Family Law of Seattle (the domain) was completely redone from the ground up. New content was created to better organize information and to better meet user needs. SEO was taken into account since the legacy site had negatively affected it for so long. And it took a fresh and different approach to aiding process of how lawyer-seekers use the websites of law firms.

          I did a few SWOT analyses and also some general research on law firms around Seattle, and also non-localized.  I looked mostly at family law firms but took into account other types of law as well so I didn't miss anything. What I found was that there was a general template that the vast majority stuck close to - much like car dealership websites. They all featured essentially the same navigation style, and handled the presentation and flow of information similarly.

          To find out better who my users were, and what their needs and wants were, I sent out a survey to a Slack group, and also posted it to Reddit. The response numbers were not overwhelming, but gave me a good sense who the key users were, and how they wanted (or would want) to do their due-diligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          To follow up on some of the new questions the survey raised, I reached out to a number of people including an former coworker who now works at AVVO (the legal social media type site), a number of friends who worked in immigration and contract law, and I cold called a firm I did a SWOT on to track down their designer and pick his brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I achieved in my research was a clear understanding of how lawyer-seekers want information to be presented to them, how they wanted to interact with hired representation, and the average knowledge levels about the process for the majority user group. I also got some useful feedback on SEO from my AVVO connect.

          The approach for this project was fairly simple by nature. I defined the basic structure of the website via a basic user journey. This was built using the information from the research on what people wanted to know, and using some behavior psychology I picked up via books I've read. First - top level - we needed to establish a personal connection. Then moving through the information from top down - what kinds of cases do they take, how did the firm handle those and what results did they get, then if all looks good, booking an appointment and preparing for it.

    <div class="contentblock">
      <p>
        Once I had the basic journey figured out, I got to work on figuring out the more micro -level user-flows for both the potential users, and for the lawyer to ensure that I kept her in her comfort zone and didn't require a new learning curve for the new website. Getting the information from the lawyer on what she needed to get out of the booking process was extremely helpful. It gave me what I needed to let the user know what to expect, how to create the online booking flow, and what they would need to bring once they were taken on as a client.

          I had a clear picture of how I wanted the site to work, but I didn't have a good idea of how I wanted it to look. The client didn't want a lot of generic legal imagery with gavels, scales, and people shaking hands smiling. So the site was going to have to be designed using mostly color, typography, and some iconography. I started with sketching up a few versions of each page, and brought it to the client to see which layouts she liked best and discuss reasoning behind her thoughts.

          For testing I put a number of preference tests and design questions into Usability Hub. That helped me out with figuring out some color schemes and contrasts, treatment of certain elements, and where thought some of the less clear links would take them within the site. I also built a quick prototype to demo with the client. This was very valuable for me as I had overlooked a few things about who my users might be. This led me to think a bit about accessibility for the site. Many of her recent clients were looking for wills (potentially elderly users) so I had to be more accomodating with some element like how to handle the menu toggle and link buttons.

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          We wanted completely new content from the old site. I had the bones of the site and the layout of each page with placeholder text. Now was our opportunity to gain little bits of ground on search rankings (SEO). The style of legal website discussed earlier in fact did present more opportunity for SEO. The way I approached combatting this while using our guided approach, was to write the content in such a way that we could leverage unique searchable terms in our content strategy. Some of the pages had less visual design and were fairly sterile in that respect, but made up ground as doubling as essentially SEO pages on top of their main purpose. To keep it clean, I layed them out with expanding cells to reveal the detail. That was where the bulk of the SEO content on the pages sat, but was hidden from view to avoid information overload which was a weakness highlighted in the strategic analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked with the client to write totally new content for each page. I had her rewrite her bio, come up with unique content for all bullet points on the "What We Do" page, write a number of case studies that made sure to use simple but searchable verbiage whenever possible, etc. Then I used her legacy site to fill in most of the blanks on the FAQ page.

        <p>
          I determined that high level mockups and a working prototype prior to development weren't absolutely necessary since the site was a quick enough build that changes could easily be made on the fly. Some of the challenges I faced involved what to do with all the white-space and creating background patterns, deciding on and illustrating new iconography to use in certain places, and seeing if I could customize the embedded Google map without creating a whole new Google API (they no longer allow that unfortunately).  So, I designed as I went and tackled these small challenges as I worked progressively through the site.

          We launched the website which was written in HTML/CSS with some light JavaScript and a third party plugin for the consultation booking which shot the booking info directly into the firms email (so my client wouldn't have to learn another method since that was her norm). It's a fairly simple and minimalist approach visually, but it takes the user - who the research defined as a novice to the legal process in most cases - on a guided tour through all the information they'll need in choosing representation.
        </p>
        <p>
          What it doesn't do, purposely so, is attempt to educate the user about the laws themselves. There are sites like LegalZoom which do a great job of that, and it doesn't address why the user landed on our site in the first place - which is to learn about the firm and if they wish to be represented by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project taught me a lot about defining the core purposes of a product. Does the solution address the problem at the most basic or direct level? It also highlighted accessibility issues and brought focus to that aspect of design more into my view. Who are the potential edge-case users, and does the design address their possible extra needs?
